Dear Mr. Wohlbier:

This is in response to your letter of 21 May 2003 in which you have
requested permission to reprint, for distribution to your customers, the
above IEEE copyrighted material.  We are happy to grant you this
permission.

Our only requirements are that you obtain the approval of the senior author
and his company before considering our permission final, and that the
following IEEE copyright/credit notice appears prominently on the first
page of each reprinted paper, with the appropri-ate details filled in:

Finally, because our policy forbids the use of our published works in any
way that might give the appearance of the IEEE backing any commercial

separate from any company-prepared literature.

Sincerely yours,
